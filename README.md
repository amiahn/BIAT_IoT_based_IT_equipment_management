# Gestion de matériel informatique basée sur l’IoT

## Introduction

This is a final year project that will be carried out at the IT maintenance department of the Banque Internationale Arabe de Tunisie (BIAT). The aim of the project is to develop a modern and automated way of managing computer hardware using IoT technology.

The project involves equipping each piece of hardware with a label, tag, or similar device for identification purposes. This will enable the specification of the hardware to be determined, its maintenance status to be tracked, and its ownership to be established.

## Objectives

The objectives of the project are as follows:

- To determine the appropriate technology for hardware identification, taking into account three essential elements: lightweight, low cost, and long-lasting energy.
- To define a suitable architecture.
- To implement and develop all elements of the proposed architecture (necessary sketches for the physical layer, communication sketches and protocols, a web/mobile interface and application protocols, etc.)

## Expected Outputs

The expected outputs of the project are:

- An IoT-based architecture for a computer hardware management application.
- A suitable technical specification for this architecture.
- Implementation of each layer of the proposed architecture.

## Equipment List

This project requires the following equipment:

- RFID, NFC, or other labels
- Readers and recorders for reading and writing to/from hardware
- Smartphone/laptop
- Data server
- Web server
- Microcontroller gateway card

## Repository Names

This project contains two repositories:

1. `BIAT_IoT`: This repository contains the Arduino sketches necessary for the physical layer and communication protocols.
2. `BIAT_WEB`: This repository contains the code for the web/mobile interface and application protocols.

## How to Install and Use:

1- Clone the `BIAT_IoT` repository onto your local machine.

2- Connect the gateway microcontroller card to your computer.

3- Upload the Arduino sketches to the microcontroller card.

4- Clone the `BIAT_WEB` repository onto your local machine.

5- Install the necessary dependencies.

6- Launch the application.
